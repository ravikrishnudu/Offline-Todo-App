A simple input bar to add Todo(s) on pressing the return-key.
A list of TODO cards where each todo is appended on creation.
Clicking on a TODO card should mark the TODO as complete and move it to the bottom of the list.
The active TODO cards should appear in order of creation (most recent on top), while the completed todo cards should appear in order of completion (most recent on top).
A reset button on the top right corner of the App to clear all Todo(s) and return to the initial state.
Hitting the refresh button (including hard refresh) in the browser should not cause any change in the state of the app (it should work like a regular offline app).
Create a Hash-tag feature:
Any text in todo matching the #hashtag pattern should be highlighted inline.
Clicking on a hashtag should act as a filter and show only Todo(s) containing that tag.
Hashtags can be stacked and the result should be only Todo(s) where all of them are present (ex. after clicking #work I should then be able to click #back-end to see Todo(s) containing both tags).
